PythonNETGrasshopperTemplate Licensing
============================================

This file attempts to include all licenses that apply within PythonNETGrasshopperTemplate (this program) source tree, in particular any that are supposed to be exposed to the end user for credit requirements for instance. 

PythonNETGrasshopperTemplate simplifies the development of Grasshopper plugins by integrating C# and Python.NET for seamless execution of Python scripts. 
Built on Python.NET and the official Grasshopper template, it enables direct access to Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas by embedding Python within C# Grasshopper components. 
Designed for efficiency, it supports Rhino 7 and 8, making plugin development in Visual Studio more structured and manageable.

Mail from <tech.eu@mcneel.com> send on 16/02/2022:

It isn't necessary to refer to a license for the Grasshopper Template, as that is a free utility we provide to our community to make development easier. If you want to reference something related to the template, you can put a note in the license file that mentions that the plugin or add-on was based on the grasshopper template, and add a link to the template repository or the template on the Visual Studio Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=McNeel.GrasshopperAssemblyforv6&ssr=false).
Finally, we do not typically see people add these references, but we do appreciate your thoroughness regarding the references used in your plugin.
