# Fixing Serial Port Detection on macOS in Grasshopper Plugins

## The Problem

When using the .NET `System.IO.Ports.SerialPort` class on macOS in a Grasshopper plugin, you might encounter the following error:

```
Exception has occurred: CLR/System.DllNotFoundException
An exception of type 'System.DllNotFoundException' occurred in RJCP.SerialPortStream.dll but was not handled in user code: 'Unable to load shared library 'libnserial.so.1' or one of its dependencies...
```

This occurs because:

1. The .NET SerialPort implementation relies on a native library (`libnserial.so.1`)
2. This library naming follows Linux conventions, not macOS conventions
3. The fallback mechanisms aren't properly implemented for macOS

## The Solution

The solution involves creating a fallback method that directly checks for serial devices in the `/dev` directory, which is the standard location on Unix-like systems including macOS.

### Step 1: Modify your PortParam.cs file

Add a try-catch block and fallback method in your `Update()` method:

```csharp
public void Update()
{
    var selected = (SelectedItems.FirstOrDefault()?.Value as GH_String)?.Value;
    
    string[] ports;
    try
    {
        ports = System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.GetPortNames();
    }
    catch (PlatformNotSupportedException)
    {
        ports = GetUnixPortNames();
    }

    // Rest of your existing Update() method...
}

// Add this fallback method for Unix-like systems
private static string[] GetUnixPortNames()
{
    var list = new List<string>();
    // First try 'cu.*' call-out ports (preferred for outgoing connections on macOS)
    try
    {
        var filesCu = Directory.GetFiles("/dev", "cu.*");
        list.AddRange(filesCu.Select(Path.GetFileName));
    }
    catch { }
    if (list.Count > 0)
        return list.ToArray();
    // If no 'cu.*', fall back to 'tty.*' devices
    try
    {
        var filesTty = Directory.GetFiles("/dev", "tty.*");
        list.AddRange(filesTty.Select(Path.GetFileName));
    }
    catch { }
    return list.ToArray();
}
```

### Step 2: Understanding macOS Serial Ports

On macOS:

- Serial devices appear in the `/dev` directory
- Outgoing connections should use `/dev/cu.*` devices
- Incoming connections can use `/dev/tty.*` devices
- The fallback method prioritizes `cu.*` devices since they're better for outgoing connections

### How It Works

1. First attempts to use the standard .NET `SerialPort.GetPortNames()` method
2. If that fails with a `PlatformNotSupportedException`, falls back to the custom `GetUnixPortNames()` method
3. The fallback method directly checks the `/dev` directory for serial devices
4. It prioritizes `cu.*` devices, which are more suitable for outgoing connections on macOS
5. If no `cu.*` devices are found, it falls back to `tty.*` devices

### Additional Considerations

- For more comprehensive serial port functionality on macOS, consider using a cross-platform serial library like SerialPortStream with proper macOS support
- Make sure your project references System.IO.Ports version 7.0.0 or higher
- This solution focuses on discovery of serial ports - you may need additional modifications if you're having issues with the actual serial communication

## Why This Works

The solution works by bypassing the problematic native library dependency and directly checking the file system for serial devices, which is a platform-agnostic approach that works on all Unix-like systems including macOS.

This approach is particularly valuable for Grasshopper plugins that need to maintain cross-platform compatibility while still offering full functionality on macOS.
